I am a Research Associate within the [Economics of Education Knowledge Hub](http://www.edhub.unsw.edu.au/about) at the University of New South Wales. 

I am also affiliated with the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course.

My research focuses on issues in Family Economics, Education and Health, where I apply modern econometric tools to answer policy-relevant questions.
