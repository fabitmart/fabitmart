I am an empirical economist working on policy evaluation, ranging from assessing the impact of environamental awards to estimating the effect of increasing the exit cost from cohabitation on partnering choices. I am affiliated to the Economics of Education Kwoledge Hub (UNSW) and to the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course. I am passionate about using modern econometric techniques to answer relevant real-world questions.

I have a strong interest in Epistemology and Philosophy of Economics, on which I wrote my undergraduate (Philosophy) dissertation.

In my free time I bake (non-sourdough) long-fermentation bread and go Sydneyâ€™s Fish Market to source the freshest fish. I enjoy cooking for others and preaching to them about Italian cuisine.
